# string destroyer 

## Overview
This repository contains a program that simply reads/opens the contents
of a text file, outputs a menu that gives options on how to destroy contents
of said text file.

The goal is not to build a polished product, but to experiment on additional
python methods that make the program easy to use.

## Problem Context
In academic settings, systems are often simplified:
- Single user
- Clean inputs
- No operational constraints

This project explores those ideas through focused, minimal examples.

---

## What This Project Explores
Depending on the module / experiment:
- How components communicate
- How strings are manipulated

---

## Usage
1. write anything in msg.txt
2. run !.py
3. destroy.
